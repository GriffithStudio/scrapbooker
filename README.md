# Scrapbook

Connects to social media feeds and stores the information locally, allowing you to display and style the information to match your brand identity.

## Usage

    rails g scrapbook twitter --users --media --hashtags

## Development

The gem is being developed as a collaboration between @GriffithStudio and @ContrarySheep.
